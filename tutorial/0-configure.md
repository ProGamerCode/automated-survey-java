## CONFIGURE THE APPLICATION
You can use [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) to set properties that your app will reference:

- ```PORT```, which provides the port number the app will listen to.  
- ```MONGOURI```, which provides the address and credentials necessary to access a MongoDB instance.  

If you chose to [deploy this application to Heroku](https://github.com/twilio/automated-survey-java), these variables will be automatically set for you.
